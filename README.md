# Awesome Cybersecurity Maturity Models

Cybersecurity Maturity Models

- [Security Operations Maturity Model (SOC-CMM)](https://www.soc-cmm.com/) - The SOC-CMM was created by [Rob van Os](https://www.linkedin.com/in/socadvisor/) as a Master's thesis research project for the master's program Master of Information Security, part of the Luleå University of Technology (LTU) educational catalog. The SOC-CMM was created using a Design Science Research approach in which a scientific approach is combined with practical testing and experiences to create a usable artifact, in this case the maturity assessment tool. The full text for the thesis can be obtained from the LTU publication portal.
