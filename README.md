# Awesome Cybersecurity Maturity Models

- [Security Operations Maturity Model (SOC-CMM)](https://www.soc-cmm.com/) - The SOC-CMM was created by [Rob van Os](https://www.linkedin.com/in/socadvisor/) as a Master's thesis research project for the master's program Master of Information Security, part of the Luleå University of Technology (LTU) educational catalog. The SOC-CMM was created using a Design Science Research approach in which a scientific approach is combined with practical testing and experiences to create a usable artifact, in this case the maturity assessment tool. The full text for the thesis can be obtained from the LTU publication portal.

- [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org/) - The mission of OWASP SAMM is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.

- [Security Awareness Maturity Model](https://www.sans.org/blog/security-awareness-maturity-model/) - Established in 2011 through a coordinated effort by over 200 security awareness officers, the Security Awareness Maturity ModelTM has become the industry standard which organizations use to not only benchmark the maturity of their program, but leverage as a strategic roadmap to both plan and communicate the impact of their program. What makes this model so powerful is that organizations can quickly determine why their program may not be having the impact they want, proven steps they can take to mature their program, and how to communicate the value of the program to their leadership. 

- [Security Culture Maturity Model](https://www.knowbe4.com/security-culture-maturity-model) - The Security Culture Maturity Model created by [KnowBe4]( https://twitter.com/knowbe4) is an evidence-driven framework for understanding and benchmarking the current security-related maturity of an organization, industry vertical, region, or any measurable group. The model’s range accounts for organizations with no formal or intentional awareness, behavior, or culture plan other than to achieve basic compliance (Level 1) all the way up to the most sophisticated organizations who seek to push beyond the pack and are actively working to shape even the unwritten rules and social dynamics of how their employees value security. Learn more about these levels below.

- [AWS Security Maturity Model](https://maturitymodel.security.aws.dev/en/model/) - The AWS Security Maturity Model is a set of guidance and documentation from AWS, intended to help an organization assess their security maturity, shape their cloud security strategy, and to prioritise future work accordingly. It’s based on AWS’ idea of how to secure workloads deployed on their systems, and makes extensive use of their services to achieve what they consider to be a strong security posture. It cross references numerous other sources, including the AWS Well Architected Framework Security Pillar, their security documentation, and a number of previously published whitepapers.

- [Threat Hunting Maturity Model](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html) - Threat Hunting Maturity Model is a five-level evaluation system of how efficient an organization is in terms of cyber hunting. Threat Hunting Model was developed by David J. Bianco [(@DavidJBianco)](https://twitter.com/DavidJBianco), a Hunter and Security Architect. The main idea of this threat hunting framework is to outline different stages of organizational cyber hunting competence.

- [Vendor Risk Management Maturity Model (VRMMM)](https://sharedassessments.org/vrmmm/) - The VRMMM evaluates third-party risk programs against a set of comprehensive best practices and industry benchmarks. The focus of the VRMMM is to provide third party risk managers with a tool they can use to evaluate their program against a comprehensive set of best practices. Using governance as the foundational element, the model identifies the framework elements critical to a successful program. High-level components are broken down into subcomponents in a manner that makes the model adaptable across a wide spectrum of industry groups. Being able to identify specific areas for improvement the VRMMM allows companies to make well-informed decisions on how to spend limited resources to most effectively manage vendor related risks.

- [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/) - The DevSecOps Maturity Model, which is presented in the talk, shows security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. For example, each component such as application libraries and operating system libraries in docker images can be tested for known vulnerabilities. Attackers are intelligent and creative, equipped with new technologies and purpose. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures are at hand implemented which counteract the attacks.

- [SOAR Maturity Model](https://chronicle.security/blog/posts/SOAR-adoption-maturity-model/) - As security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) adoption continues at a rapid pace,  security operations teams have a greater need for a structured planning approach.

- [Consumer Authentication Strength Maturity Model (CASMM)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/casmm-consumer-authentication-security-maturity-model/) - An easy-to-use security model for the average internet user. Basically, how secure is someone’s current behavior with respect to passwords and authentication, and how can they improve? People like moving up rankings, so let’s use that! The first way to use this model is to simply ask the user about their current behavior and show them where that ranks within these 8 Levels. If you show them they’re down at Level 1 or 2, the combination of seeing how low they are in the chart and the color might convey some measure of concern. Next, show them how to move upwards in the model!

- [Zero-trust Maturity Model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model) - CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model is one of many roadmaps for agencies to reference as they transition towards a zero trust architecture. The goal of the maturity model is to assist agencies in the development of their zero trust strategies and implementation plans and present ways in which various CISA services can support zero trust solutions across agencies. The maturity model, which include five pillars and three cross-cutting capabilities, is based on the foundations of zero trust. Within each pillar, the maturity model provides agencies with specific examples of a traditional, advanced, and optimal zero trust architecture.

- [Red Team Maturity Model](https://www.redteams.fyi/) - A model to reference when gauging Red Team maturity, as well as set goals and provide guidance when building internal Red Teams.

- [CyberSecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-capability-maturity-model-c2m2) - Organizations can use the C2M2 to consistently measure their cybersecurity capabilities over time, identify target maturity levels based on risk, and prioritize the actions and investments that allow them to meet their targets. U.S. energy organizations have been using the C2M2 to evaluate and improve their cybersecurity capabilities for more than a decade. Since 2012, DOE has responded to more than 2,400 requests for the C2M2 PDF-based Tool from owners and operators in U.S. critical infrastructure sectors and international partners that are adopting the model. Increasing tool requests suggests a growing adoption of the C2M2 across the globe.

- [Vulnerability Management Maturity Model](https://www.sans.org/posters/key-metrics-cloud-enterprise-vmmm/) - The SANS Vulnerability Management Maturity Model helps you gauge the effectiveness of your Vulnerability Management program. The model details key activities performed within Vulnerability Management on a 5-point scale. Leveraging the model, you can categorize your program’s current capabilities to create a clear roadmap to improve your program.

- [IoT Security Maturity Model](https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/SMM_Description_and_Intended_Use_FINAL_Updated_V1.1.pdf) - The goal of a Security Maturity Model (SMM) is to provide a path for Internet of Things (IoT) providers to know where they need to be and how to invest in security mechanisms that meet their requirements without over-investing in unnecessary security mechanisms. It seeks to help organizations identify the appropriate approach for effective enhancement of these practices where needed. Deciding where to focus limited security resources is a challenge for most organizations given the complexity of a constantly changing security landscape.

- [ENISA Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) Maturity Framework](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-csirt-maturity-framework) - The ENISA CSIRT Maturity Framework is intended to contribute to the enhancement of the global capacity to manage cyber incidents, with a focus on CSIRTs. Cyber incidents and developments are inherently transnational and effective responses depend on transnational collaboration. The establishment of national CSIRTs1 is an essential step to facilitate the building of cyber capacity both within and across nations and make it more effective. The ENISA CSIRT Maturity Framework is aimed at parties involved in planning, building and leading such capacities with a concrete focus to increase maturity of all CSIRTs in the CSIRTs Network.

- [API Security Maturity Model](https://curity.io/resources/learn/the-api-security-maturity-model/) - Inspired by the Richardson Maturity Model, which outlines increasing degrees of web service development maturity, the API Security Maturity Model reframes the model within the context of security. Within this model, security and trust are improved the higher up you go.

- [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](https://www.bsimm.com/) - BSIMM is a data-driven model developed through analysis of real-world software security initiatives (also known as application or product security programs). BSIMM13, published in September 2022, represents the latest evolution of this detailed measuring stick for software security.
