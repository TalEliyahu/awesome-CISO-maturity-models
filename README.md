# Awesome Cybersecurity Maturity Models

- [Security Operations Maturity Model (SOC-CMM)](https://www.soc-cmm.com/) - The SOC-CMM was created by [Rob van Os](https://www.linkedin.com/in/socadvisor/) as a Master's thesis research project for the master's program Master of Information Security, part of the Luleå University of Technology (LTU) educational catalog. The SOC-CMM was created using a Design Science Research approach in which a scientific approach is combined with practical testing and experiences to create a usable artifact, in this case the maturity assessment tool. The full text for the thesis can be obtained from the LTU publication portal.

- Security Awareness Maturity Model - Established in 2011 through a coordinated effort by over 200 security awareness officers, the Security Awareness Maturity ModelTM has become the industry standard which organizations use to not only benchmark the maturity of their program, but leverage as a strategic roadmap to both plan and communicate the impact of their program. What makes this model so powerful is that organizations can quickly determine why their program may not be having the impact they want, proven steps they can take to mature their program, and how to communicate the value of the program to their leadership. 

- [Security Culture Maturity Model](https://www.knowbe4.com/security-culture-maturity-model) - The Security Culture Maturity Model created by [KnowBe4]( https://twitter.com/knowbe4) is an evidence-driven framework for understanding and benchmarking the current security-related maturity of an organization, industry vertical, region, or any measurable group. The model’s range accounts for organizations with no formal or intentional awareness, behavior, or culture plan other than to achieve basic compliance (Level 1) all the way up to the most sophisticated organizations who seek to push beyond the pack and are actively working to shape even the unwritten rules and social dynamics of how their employees value security. Learn more about these levels below.

- [AWS Security Maturity Model](https://maturitymodel.security.aws.dev/en/model/) - The AWS Security Maturity Model is a set of guidance and documentation from AWS, intended to help an organization assess their security maturity, shape their cloud security strategy, and to prioritise future work accordingly. It’s based on AWS’ idea of how to secure workloads deployed on their systems, and makes extensive use of their services to achieve what they consider to be a strong security posture. It cross references numerous other sources, including the AWS Well Architected Framework Security Pillar, their security documentation, and a number of previously published whitepapers.

- [Threat Hunting Maturity Model](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html) - Threat Hunting Maturity Model is a five-level evaluation system of how efficient an organization is in terms of cyber hunting. Threat Hunting Model was developed by David J. Bianco [(@DavidJBianco)](https://twitter.com/DavidJBianco), a Hunter and Security Architect. The main idea of this threat hunting framework is to outline different stages of organizational cyber hunting competence.

- [Vendor Risk Management Maturity Model (VRMMM)](https://sharedassessments.org/vrmmm/) - The VRMMM evaluates third-party risk programs against a set of comprehensive best practices and industry benchmarks. The focus of the VRMMM is to provide third party risk managers with a tool they can use to evaluate their program against a comprehensive set of best practices. Using governance as the foundational element, the model identifies the framework elements critical to a successful program. High-level components are broken down into subcomponents in a manner that makes the model adaptable across a wide spectrum of industry groups. Being able to identify specific areas for improvement the VRMMM allows companies to make well-informed decisions on how to spend limited resources to most effectively manage vendor related risks.

- [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/) - The DevSecOps Maturity Model, which is presented in the talk, shows security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. For example, each component such as application libraries and operating system libraries in docker images can be tested for known vulnerabilities. Attackers are intelligent and creative, equipped with new technologies and purpose. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures are at hand implemented which counteract the attacks.
